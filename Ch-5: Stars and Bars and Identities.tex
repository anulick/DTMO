\chapter{Stars, Bars and Hockey Sticks}
\section{Introduction}
While almost all problems can be solved using the CCC, sometimes its quicker to remember a certain fact. This chapter goes through some facts which should be kept in mind as such configurations occur quite often.
\section{Stars and Bars}
\begin{example}
    [Motivating Example] In how many ways can 10 choclates be divided among 3 children(The children are distinguishable, the choclates aren't)?
\end{example}
\begin{proof}
    [Solution]
    Let's re frame the question as ways to insert two identical dividers in a line of 10 chocolates. We are looking for the permutations of this(Think of why this is exactly the same thing)\\
    The number of such permutations will be: $\frac{(10+2)!}{2!*10!}$\\
    Which is equal to 66.
\end{proof}
Generalizing this: 
\begin{theorem}
[Stars and Bars]
    we can say that n objects can be put in k distinguishable bins in   $\frac{(n+k-1)!}{n!*(k-1)!}=\binom{n+k-1}{n}$
\end{theorem}
The Stars and Bars has various uses
\begin{example}
    Alice has 24 apples. In how many ways can she share them with Becky and Chris so that each of the three people has at least two apples?
\end{example}
\section{Counting in two ways}
While playing the guessing game, you may have found yourself having two or more ways to solve the same question both ,hopefully, leading to the same answer. But as one method is easier to compute than the other, we use that. But if we think about it, given a configuration, we should get the same number of permutation or combination using any method.\\
This idea is what we use. We calculate the same, generalized thing in two ways and equate them to get an identity, which we can use elsewhere as it is true in general.\\
This is called counting in two ways. Let's see it in action:
\begin{example}
    [Motivating Example]
    How many councils with at least 1 member and at most n members be made from a pool of n people?
\end{example}
\begin{proof}
    [Solution]
    We obviously know that the answer is $2^n - 1$ from the subset theorem. \\
    However we can also write this as $\binom{n}{1} + \binom{n}{2} \dots \binom{n}{n}$\\
    We can, hence say, $\binom{n}{1} + \binom{n}{2} \dots \binom{n}{n}= 2^n -1$ \\
    $\therefore \binom{n}{1} + \binom{n}{2} \dots \binom{n}{n} +1 = 2^n$ \\
    as we know $\binom{n}{0}=1$, we can say: $\binom{n}{0} + \binom{n}{1} + \binom{n}{2} \dots \binom{n}{n} = 2^n$
\end{proof}
What we just derived is called the Binomial identity.
\begin{theorem}
    $\binom{n}{0} + \binom{n}{1} + \binom{n}{2} \dots \binom{n}{n} = 2^n$
\end{theorem}
This is surprisingly useful even in algebra.\\
\begin{example}
    [Motivating Example]
     Suppose a committee consists of m men and n women. In how many ways can a subcommittee of r members be formed?
\end{example}
\begin{proof}
    [Solution]
    We obviously know that the answer is $\binom{m+n}{r}$ from the subset theorem. \\
    However we can also write this as $\binom{m}{0}*\binom{n}{r-0} + \binom{m}{1}*\binom{n}{r-1} \dots +\binom{m}{r-1}*\binom{n}{1}+\binom{m}{r}*\binom{n}{0}$\\
    We can, hence say, $\binom{m}{0}*\binom{n}{r-0} + \binom{m}{1}*\binom{n}{r-1} \dots +\binom{m}{r-1}*\binom{n}{1}+\binom{m}{r}*\binom{n}{0}=\binom{m+n}{r}$ \\
    \end{proof}
This is called Vandermondeâ€™s Identity.
\begin{theorem}
    $\binom{m}{0}*\binom{n}{r-0} + \binom{m}{1}*\binom{n}{r-1} \dots +\binom{m}{r-1}*\binom{n}{1}+\binom{m}{r}*\binom{n}{0}=\binom{m+n}{r}$
\end{theorem}
\section{Pascal's Triangle}
\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{Photos/pascal triangle.png}
\end{figure}
The triangle somewhere on the top of the page is called Pascal's triangle. \\
It has a lot of fun and amazing properties(try to find them, you'll be surprised).\\
We are going to exploit two of them right now. First being, Every term in subsequent line is made by adding the two above it. The second being that it can be written as follows:
\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{Photos/Binomial Pascal.png}
\end{figure}
This is exceptionally useful as this leads us to Pascal's Identity
\begin{theorem}
    $\binom{n}{k} + \binom{n}{k+1}=\binom{n+1}{k+1}$
\end{theorem}
and the hockey stick identity(try looking at a diagonal)
\begin{theorem}
    $\binom{k}{k}+\binom{k+1}{k}+ \dots +\binom{n}{k}=\binom{n+1}{k+1}$
\end{theorem}
These identities can be memorized quite simply by writing them on a piece of paper and taping them to a wall next to where you sleep. Every morning look at it just after you wake up, and every night just before you sleep. You'll have them memorized in less then a week.\\
The another way to remember the is by simply solving the questions and deriving every identity you forget, no turning the pages back. That will get it done in less than  two hours flat.\\

\item (AIME 2011) \points{5} Ed has five identical green marbles, and a large supply of identical red marbles. He arranges the green marbles and some of the red ones in a row and finds that the number of marbles whose right hand neighbor is the same color as themselves is equal to the number of marbles whose right hand neighbor is the other color. An example of such an arrangement is $GGRRRGGRG$.

Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000$.
\begin{hint}
    \addhint{$m$ is limited by the fact that number of marbles whose right hand neighbor is the other color is maximum 10. How many red marbles will we need for this to lead to a valid arrangement?}
